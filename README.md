# Deep-learning-based-end-to-end-speech-recognition
The goal of this project is to get familiar with applications that require speech data as input.
We would be using the torchaudio library (pip install torchaudio==0.11.0), please carefull read this tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/speech_recognition_pipeline_tutorial.html

This dataset is selected from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, a famous speech-based application benchmark.

General torchaudio tutorials: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html


File Descriptions:

Speech Recognition.ipynb - The file that contains the whole project.

labels.csv - The file that contains annotated transcripts with 3 columns( File name, origional text, normalized origional text).

wav - This folder contains the records files.
